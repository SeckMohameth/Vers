## Overview
This is the source code for the very first concept of the Vers video sharing app (Not all the code is here, just what I can get on Github üòÖ files were big and too many). Started in December 2016 to January 2019.
Currently working on a newer version of the app in a private repo.

I started this project back in December 2016. This was before I ever learned to code and outsourced the developement to a company in India (code they wrote is in this repo), because studios in the US were charging $20,000+. This costed a few grand (The project was that serious).


### Definitely recommend reading to learn more about the app.

# Introduction
![alt text](https://github.com/SeckMohameth/Vers-2016-2019/blob/master/Images/IMG_0759.jpeg?raw=true)
Vers, short for Versus, is a video sharing app and this version was specifically focused on sending video challenges to one another. The idea came to me after a week or two of using Snap chat for the first time. That same night sitting at the Kitchen table I came up with a few concepts for the app. I was brain storming ideas to make money and thought about making an app. At first I thought it would be easy, but then I started doing research. First, I found out you a need a Mac to build iOS apps and at the time I thought you just needed any computer to build for both Android and iOS. So much for that new HP computer I just bought for college. After more digging I learned about what a frontend was, and then a backend, and then databases, and well a lot of things I didn't know about at the time. I started a GoFundMe to get a Mac Book Pro and that raised $600. After finally finding a job I was able come up with the other half a buy a Mac.


# Motivation
I was introduced to programming in college, but it was this project that made me want to become a software engineer. The idea of having something go from my head to the palm of my hands was everything to me. What was better than that was building something that potentially  millions of people could use.

# My Role

### Designs & Prototype

I designed the UI/UX and wireframing of the app. I wrote an eleven page document detailing all the functionalities of the app and sent it to the developers. I used Sketch, some AdobeXD, and Invsion for wireframing and prototyping. Literally I just needed someone to build my app for me since it would've took too long for me to learn how to code, code it, and then release it. Not to mention an Adroid version. The company also built an Admin panel for the app so that I can monitor users content for anything that went against the community guidlines I created. That was built with Bootstrap and php.

### Marketing

I handled a majority of the Marketing along with another friend. I used social media to promote the app, paid for ads on Facebook and Instagram, and passed flyers around campus. I beta tested using Apple's Testflight and gained feedback on improvements. I updated users on the social media accounts on bug fixes and new features.

A few friends helped me with this. I edited and recored most of the video.

### Business

I also wrote a business plan and pitch deck just in case the app took off üòâ

 This one is old, but the only one I can find. I had a better plan than this one üí°
 
 ### More Background info
 I was attedning the University of Hartford when I was developing the App. After tons of rejections from Apple it was exciting and fufilling to see it live on the App Store and Google Play Store. It was live until Febaury 2019, just after I started attending Holberton School. The app was developed by [Hiteshi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hiteshi/) who I found on the freelancing site guru and then switched them over to Upwork. I interviewd about 60+ solo developers and companies to find the right people to bring my idea to life. I used AWS EC2 and S3 to host the app.
 
# What Failed ‚òπÔ∏è & what I learned üß†
- There was no onboarding for the app so users were confused on how it worked. This is what led to writing the medium blog post. Users even struggled with signing up on the app.
- Not enough marketing. Just because you built it doesn't mean they'll come.
- Costly. I had to pay for every feature I wanted to add, but the development company did fix bugs that arrise for free.
- TEAM!!! I learned if I'm ever going to start a business I need the right team. I'm grateful for the help of my friends, but sometimes business partners should probably not be your closest friends. 

Ultimately, not being able to code or finding a techinical partner were big issues.

## The New VRS
Project VRS is now just a long term fun side proeject. You can follow me on social media and the VRS social accounts for updates on the project. I have lots of ideas I want to explore and build with this one. It will continue to be a growing project. I'm proud I was able to create and launch my app idea, but this time I'm going to be the one to code it. This one has to come from my hands. I'm working on this in a private repo so you'll have to wait until it's live to see the new Vers.

**Note**
I will be publishing the very first version of the new Vers App in another repo after completing it. Along with a blog post explaining the new app. Stay tuned.
