# Vers-2016-2019

## Overview
This is the source code for the very first concept of the Vers video sharing app. Started in December 2016 to January 2019.
Currently working on a new one in a private repo.

I started this project back in December 2016. This was before I ever learned to code and outsourced the developement to a company in India, because studios in the US were charging $20,000+. This costed a few grand (The project was that serious).
